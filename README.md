# InventoryCrudApp

This is a CRUD implementation of inventory of a Grocery Store built using Python, Flask, and a SQLite databse. Additionally, I implemented undo delete and deletion comment features.

After launching the application and visiting the home page ... 

Append /create to the url to add items

Append /data to view all items

Append /data/"id"/update to the url to add items, where "id" is the id of an item

Append /data/"id"/delete to delete items

Append /data/"id"/undelete to undo a delete

Append /data/deleted to view deleted items
